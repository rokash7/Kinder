# Software engineering I project
"Kinder" project about karma
made by Justas, Olegas, Rokas, Konstantinas

## IDEA
a takers/givers app inspired by Tinder's concept

"Takers" register what items are they short of
"Givers" register what items they have to donate

"takers" or "givers" analise and swipe right if they see fit to communicate about donation, otherwise swipe left

each donation is worth some amount of Karma points, betermined by "taker". 
"givers" have leaderboards, to drive better engagement to participate in charity
